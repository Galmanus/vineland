// Solana biometric wallet binding (passkey, non-custodial).
//
// LazorKit is the active wallet: a passkey smart wallet that verifies the device
// P-256 assertion ON-CHAIN via the secp256r1 precompile (SIMD-0075, mainnet since
// 2025-06), so a paymaster sponsors gas WITHOUT custody — the user's funds move
// only because the on-chain program accepts the passkey. This mirrors the Stellar
// passkey/relayer model (lib/passkey.ts) on Solana.
//
// LazorKit's API is a React hook (useWallet) — connect()/signAndSendTransaction
// live in component land. The bridge (components/SolanaWalletGate) binds a
// connected wallet here as a plain executor so the chain adapter stays React-free.
//
// NON-CUSTODIAL caveat for mainnet cutover: LazorKit V2's audit is INTERNAL (not
// an independent third-party audit) with noted critical/high items. Acceptable on
// devnet; revisit before mainnet with real funds.
