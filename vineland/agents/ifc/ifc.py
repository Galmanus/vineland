"""Information-flow control (non-interference) checker for inter-agent
composition.

This is **Mechanism 4** of Vineland's agent-integrity stack. Where Mechanism 3
(``agents/tee``) attests *which policy+model produced a decision*, this one
attests *that no high-confidentiality / high-integrity datum reaches a lower
sink across an agent-to-agent channel without passing an explicit, declared
declassification point*.

The attack class it targets is covert collusion / steganographic escalation
between composed agents — the Colosseum/Whispers family — where agent A holds a
secret (a key, a PII record, a privileged instruction) and smuggles it to a
lower-trust agent C by hiding it inside a message that is *labelled* low. If the
flow graph declares that A's output is HIGH and the A->C edge feeds a LOW sink,
this checker flags it. There is no honest label under which secret HIGH data may
ride a LOW-cleared channel; the only sanctioned way down the lattice is through
a ``declassify`` node that the graph author had to write on purpose and that an
auditor can read.

WHAT THIS PROVES (and what it does NOT) — see README.md for the long form:

- It proves the **DECLARED** flow graph satisfies non-interference under a
  security-label lattice: for every channel, the (propagated, join-on-merge)
  label of the data at the source is <= the clearance of the sink, OR an
  explicit declassify node on the path downgrades it within its declared,
  bounded allowance.
- It does **NOT** discover undeclared side channels. If two agents share a
  covert timing/cache/length channel that nobody put in the graph as an edge,
  this checker is blind to it — exactly like a type system is blind to a
  Spectre gadget. The guarantee is relative to the completeness of the declared
  model. Disanalogy with a runtime taint tracker: a dynamic IFC monitor sees
  the bytes that actually move and can catch an implicit flow at runtime; this
  is a *static* check over a *declared* graph, so its soundness is bounded by
  whether the graph author declared every real channel as an edge.
- IFC is **known for false positives**: a label-propagation checker over-rejects
  legitimate flows (the classic "label creep" — once a value touches HIGH, its
  join stays HIGH and poisons everything downstream). The cure is *designed*
  declassification points, which themselves are the trusted core: a wrong
  declassify allowance is a hole the checker will happily wave through. We make
  declassification explicit, bounded, and auditable, but we cannot prove a
  declassify node is *semantically* justified — only that it exists and that the
  author scoped it.

The lattice algebra (join/leq), the label propagation with merge-join, the
declassify accounting, and the cycle-safe fixpoint are real and tested. The
*completeness of the declared graph* and the *justification of each declassify*
are the trusted, human-supplied parts. See README.md.

Pure, Result-style, no panics: every public function returns a value (a
``CheckResult`` or a ``(bool, reason)``); malformed graphs are reported as
violations, never raised.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# (a) The security-label lattice.
#
# We use a powerset-of-tags lattice. A label is a frozenset of confidentiality
# *categories* (tags): {"pii"}, {"key", "pii"}, the empty set (== PUBLIC), etc.
#
#   - PARTIAL ORDER (leq): label X "may flow to" sink-clearance Y iff X is a
#     SUBSET of Y. Reading the lattice as confidentiality: a sink cleared for
#     categories Y can receive data whose categories X are all within Y. Data
#     tagged {"key"} flowing to a sink cleared only for {"pii"} is rejected
#     because {"key"} is NOT a subset of {"pii"}.
#   - JOIN (least upper bound): set UNION. When two flows merge at a node, the
#     result carries the union of their tags — the conservative, monotone move
#     that makes label propagation sound (you can only gain tags going forward,
#     never silently lose one). PUBLIC (empty set) is the bottom; the union of
#     all declared tags is the top.
#
# This is a genuine lattice: union is associative/commutative/idempotent with
# identity emptyset; subset is a partial order; (P(T), subset, union) is the
# canonical example of a bounded lattice. Choosing powerset-of-tags over a
# linear LOW<HIGH chain lets us express incomparable secrets (a {"key"} flow and
# a {"pii"} flow are *incomparable* — neither may substitute for the other),
# which a totally-ordered level scheme cannot.
#
# Integrity is the dual: model an integrity requirement as a tag too (e.g.
# "trusted") and read it with the same subset rule by tagging *untrusted* inputs
# and requiring high-integrity sinks to carry no untrusted tag. We expose the
# confidentiality reading by default and document the dual in README.

# (b) The flow-graph model.
#
# Three node kinds, all carried in one ``Node`` for simplicity, distinguished by
# ``kind``:
#
#   - "agent": an agent. Has ``input_clearance`` (the highest label it is
#     cleared to RECEIVE — i.e. the sink-side clearance for edges pointing INTO
#     it) and ``output_label`` (the *intrinsic* label the agent stamps on data
#     it ORIGINATES, e.g. a secrets-holder originates {"key"}). The label that
#     actually leaves an agent is join(intrinsic output, everything that flowed
#     in) — that is the label-creep-honest propagation.
#   - "source": a pure origin of data at a fixed label (no inputs). Sugar for an
#     agent with no in-edges; kept separate so test graphs read clearly.
#   - "sink": a pure consumer with an ``input_clearance`` and no out-edges.
#   - "declassify": the ONLY sanctioned downgrade and the trusted boundary.
#     Carries ``removes`` (the tags it is permitted to strip). Data passing
#     through it has exactly those tags removed from its propagated label, and
#     nothing else changes. A declassify that removes {"pii"} turns
#     {"pii","audit"} into {"audit"} and lets it reach a sink cleared {"audit"}.
#     It is powerless over tags not in ``removes``. An edge INTO a declassify is
#     never itself a leak: the node is, by construction, cleared to receive
#     whatever it is about to downgrade (else declassification would be
#     unreachable). The bounded, auditable part is what it strips — checked on
#     its OUT-edges — NOT what it accepts. This is exactly why a declassify is
#     trusted-core: a too-broad ``removes`` is a hole the checker waves through.
#
# Edges are directed channels carrying labelled data from src to dst.

    Transitivity (A->B->C) is enforced for free by the fixpoint: B's out-label is
    join(B intrinsic, A's label), so a HIGH origin at A is still HIGH leaving B
