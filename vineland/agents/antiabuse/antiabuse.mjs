// AntiAbuseAgent — enforcement core ("the teeth"). The panopticon.
//
// Observes cross-agent activity and can HALT any agent. Two deterministic gates
// for money events (velocity, conservation) and a non-interference gate for
// inter-agent messages (no high-label data to a lower sink — kills covert
// collusion / stego escalation). HALT is mechanical: a halted agent is
// recompiled to the EMPTY toolset (Axl bind), losing its entire action space —
// it is disarmed, not asked to stand down.
//
// AntiAbuse is the most dangerous agent (root over the others), so it itself
// holds NO money capability. Treat it like root: hard ACL, immutable audit,
// external kill-switch (see antiabuse.ssl).
//
// Note on scope: the inter-agent label check here is the money-path-local guard.
// The canonical, full non-interference checker (lattice + least-fixpoint over the
// declared flow graph) is agents/ifc/ (Python, 16/16). In production AntiAbuse
// delegates whole-graph checks to it; this module keeps the per-event gate.
