"""TEE attestation envelope — provenance of which policy+model computed a money
decision, bound by a deterministic digest, signed by a (mock) enclave, anchored
on-chain next to the wallet's ``ssl_hash``.

This is **Mechanism 3** of Vineland's agent-integrity stack. It extends the
``ssl_hash`` idea already pinned on-chain
(`contracts/smart-wallet/src/lib.rs:162` — sha256 of the governing `.ssl` spec)
from *which policy* to *which policy ran inside which attested binary on which
declared model when it produced this exact decision*.

WHAT THIS GIVES YOU (and what it does NOT) — see README.md for the long form:

- It binds, non-repudiably, four facts to one decision: the policy hash, the
  model id, the enclave measurement (PCR / launch measurement), and a nonce.
  A verifier can later prove the bytes of a money decision were produced under a
  declared policy + model inside a binary whose measurement is on a trust list.
- It does NOT prove the decision was *correct*. TEE attests **provenance, not
  correctness** — a buggy or adversarial-but-honestly-declared model produces a
  perfectly valid envelope. "Provably the declared model" != "provably right".
- It is NOT trustless. TEE roots trust in the hardware vendor (AWS Nitro / AMD).
  The chain of trust terminates at a vendor root cert, not at math you can check
  without trusting a manufacturer. Disanalogy with a zk-proof: a zk-proof needs
  no trusted party for soundness; a TEE attestation is only as sound as the
  vendor's key custody and the absence of a hardware/microcode break.
- The signature here is produced by a **MOCK** enclave (`MockEnclave`). No Nitro
  / SEV-SNP hardware exists in this environment, so the real vendor attestation
  document (the CBOR/COSE Nitro doc, or the SEV-SNP ATTESTATION_REPORT) and its
  certificate-chain verification up to the AWS/AMD root are **not** performed.
  That step is infra-gated and explicitly out of scope. See README.md.

The verification logic, canonicalization, digest binding, and replay defence are
real and tested. Only the *origin of trust in the measurement+signature* is
mocked.

    """The attestation envelope a real enclave would emit alongside a decision.

    Every field is a fact the enclave commits to. ``signature`` covers the
    sha256 *binding digest* over the other five fields, so any single-bit change
    to any committed field invalidates the signature.

    Fields:
      policy_hash:          sha256 (hex) of the governing `.ssl` spec. The SAME
                            value pinned on-chain as the wallet session's
                            ``ssl_hash`` (lib.rs:162). This is the join key
                            between the envelope and the on-chain anchor.
      model_id:             the declared model that ran inside the enclave, e.g.
                            "claude-opus-4-8" or a pinned weights digest. What
                            "provenance" means here: provably THIS id, not a
                            silent swap to a cheaper/uncensored model.
      enclave_measurement:  the enclave's launch measurement. On AWS Nitro this
                            is a PCR set (PCR0/1/2 are SHA-384 hex). On AMD
                            SEV-SNP it is the ATTESTATION_REPORT.MEASUREMENT.
                            Opaque hex here; the verifier checks set-membership
                            against a trust list of known-good measurements.
      decision:            the money decision, as CANONICAL BYTES. The enclave
                            attests the exact bytes it emitted. Stored bytes so
                            there is no "which serialization?" ambiguity at
                            verify time — the producer canonicalizes once.
      nonce:               per-decision unique value. Replay defence: a verifier
                            tracks seen nonces and accepts each at most once,
                            mirroring the wallet's nonce-once rule and the
                            AuthorityAgent's `seen_nonces`.
      signature:           enclave signature over `binding_digest(...)`. bytes.
      sig_alg:             "ed25519" or "hmac-sha256-standin" — records which
                            backend produced `signature` so a verifier can refuse

    Gate order is chosen so the cheapest, most-specific rejections come first and
    the reason string is the first failing gate (useful for audit logs):

      0. sig_alg       — the envelope's declared algorithm must equal the
                         caller-pinned ``expected_sig_alg`` (defaults to the
                         active ``SIG_BACKEND``). ``env.sig_alg`` is an

                         other gate's trust root; dispatching the signature check
                         on it without pinning is the JWT ``alg`` confusion hole.
                         Pinning out-of-band here is the primary fix; a verifier
                         must never let the envelope choose its own algorithm.
      1. policy_hash   — envelope must claim the policy the caller demands. A
                         decision under a different (e.g. weakened) policy is
                         rejected even if perfectly signed.
      2. measurement   — the enclave measurement must be on the trust list. An
                         honestly-signed envelope from an UNKNOWN binary is
                         rejected; this is the membership check that a real
                         verifier does AFTER validating the vendor doc (the
                         vendor-doc validation itself is infra-gated, not here).
      3. signature     — the enclave signature must verify over the recomputed
                         binding digest. Recomputation from the envelope's own
                         fields (now INCLUDING sig_alg) is what makes a tampered
                         `decision` (or any other committed field) fail: the
                         digest moves, the sig doesn't.
      4. replay        — if a nonce set is supplied, the nonce must be unseen.
                         Accepted nonces are recorded (side effect) so the same
                         envelope can't settle twice. Matches the wallet's
                         nonce-once rule and AuthorityAgent.seen_nonces.
