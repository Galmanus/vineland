// Axl `bind` primitive — capability filtering at the tool-list level.
//
// The guarantee under test is MECHANICAL, not advisory: an agent bound to a
// capability set receives, as its `tools=[...]` array for the model call, ONLY
// the tool schemas for those capabilities. A capability it is not bound to has
// NO schema in the action space — so the model cannot emit a valid tool_use for
// it, regardless of any prompt injection. This is the difference between
// "the policy says don't" (advisory) and "the action does not exist" (mechanical).
