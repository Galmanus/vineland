"""
Axl mechanism #1 — machine-checked policy invariant (Z3 / SMT).

This is the 5/5 step `prove` cannot reach: instead of checking ONE transaction,
it proves a property over the ENTIRE space of agent action sequences. It models
the deployed agent_wallet budget policy (contracts/smart-wallet/src/lib.rs,
try_authorize_agent_transfer) and proves what its worst-case real-time-window
outflow actually is — inductively, for all reachable states, not by example.

It deliberately tries to BREAK the naive claim first. The honest result is the
one the audit already documented (N-A3): the bound is 2*window_cap, NOT
window_cap, because of the sliding-window straddle. The SMT machine rediscovers
that independently — that is the auditor-grade artifact.

Overlap lemma (geometric premise, stated not SMT-proved here): the epoch rolls
only when elapsed >= W, so consecutive epoch boundaries are >= W apart in real
time; therefore any real-time window of length W overlaps AT MOST two adjacent
epochs, and the outflow it sees is <= prev_spent + cur_spent at that time.
