Verified Spending Policy — a prover that issues a machine-checked SAFETY
CERTIFICATE for an agent spending policy, and REFUSES to certify the unsafe ones.

Positioning (Stellar / x402 agent economy): x402 and MPP are live on Stellar
mainnet; the explicit value prop is "programmable payment policies — spending
limits, approval rules — guardrails without removing autonomy." Every agent
wallet today CAPS spend. None ships a proof that the cap cannot be exceeded over
all action sequences. This does: it certifies the worst-case window outflow of a
policy as K * window_cap, proves K is tight, and fail-closed refuses a policy
with no provable bound.

This generalizes mechanism #1 (budget_invariant.py) from the one deployed policy
to a parameterized family: the policy's aggregate-ceiling multiplier M is the
knob; the prover returns the PROVED bound K, or refuses.

K is NOT always M. The weighted throughput check independently binds prev and
cur to <= window_cap each, so for any M >= 2 the proved bound is 2*window_cap
regardless of a looser declared ceiling — the prover reports this as a
diagnostic ("nominal ceiling looser than proved bound", i.e. the ceiling is not
the binding constraint). M = 1 binds tighter than the weighted check (K = 1).
A policy with no aggregate cap is unbounded and is REFUSED.

Honest scope (verified by adversarial review):
  - The proved object is the epoch-state invariant prev+cur <= K*window_cap; the
    real-time-window bound follows by the OVERLAP LEMMA (a W-window touches <= 2
    adjacent epochs since rolls fire only at elapsed >= W). The lemma is a true
    geometric premise, stated not machine-checked here.
  - The proof is over unbounded mathematical integers. The contract uses
    saturating i128: at astronomically large caps the weighted product can
    saturate and relax THROUGHPUT shaping, but the unweighted hard ceiling
    (saturating_add, fail-closed, reject if > 2*window_cap) still enforces the
    2*window_cap real-time envelope — the SAFETY bound K=2 is not invalidated.
  - Non-linear or unbounded-state policies are out of Z3's decidable reach — the
    prover REFUSES them, it does not pretend.
