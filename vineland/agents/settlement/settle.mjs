// Decides whether an observed on-chain payment validly settles an order. This
// is a pure decision function: it proposes a settlement, it does NOT move money
// (the transfer already happened on-chain; the wallet contract bounded it). Its
// job is to bind a real payment to the order the buyer consented to.
//
// The recipient check is the fix for the live redirection hole at
// supabase/functions/api/routes/orders.ts:130, where merchant_stellar_address is
// resolved at read time. Settlement verifies the payment landed on the recipient
// PINNED ON THE ORDER at charge time (order.consentedRecipient), so rotating the
// merchant address after consent cannot redirect a buyer's funds.
//
// `prove`, decidable → code: every check here is deterministic arithmetic/equality,
// never an LLM judge.
