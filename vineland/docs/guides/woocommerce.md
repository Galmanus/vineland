cd /tmp/vineland/plugins
zip -r ~/woocommerce-vineland.zip woocommerce-vineland/

### Option C: composer (advanced)

    {
      "type": "vcs",
      "url": "https://github.com/Galmanus/vineland.git"
    }
  ],
  "require": {
    "galmanus/vineland-wc": "dev-main"
  }
}
```

Note: requires post-install hook to move the plugin from `vendor/` to
`wp-content/plugins/`.

## Configure

### Step 1: get an API key

Sign up at [api.vineland.cc/signup](https://api.vineland.cc/signup),
create a merchant, drop your Stellar receive address, and copy the
`sk_live_…` key from the Settings tab.

### Step 2: configure WooCommerce

**WooCommerce → Settings → Payments → Vineland**

| field | value |
|---|---|
| Enable | ✓ checked |
| Environment | `testnet` (until you've tested end-to-end) |
| Title at checkout | what buyers see, e.g., "Pay with Vineland (USDC or PYUSD)" |
| Description | rendered under the title at checkout |
| API base URL | `https://api.vineland.cc` (don't change unless self-hosting) |
| API key | `sk_live_...` from your dashboard |
| Default settlement asset | USDC or PYUSD |
| Webhook secret | a long random string; **must match what's in the Vineland merchant dashboard** |

### Step 3: configure the webhook on Vineland

In your Vineland merchant dashboard (Settings tab), set:

```
webhook_url = https://your-store.com/wc-api/wc_vineland
webhook_secret = <same string as in step 2>
```

Save. The plugin handles the rest.

## What buyers see

At the WC checkout page, Vineland appears alongside other payment methods:

```
[ Cartão de crédito  ]  Visa, Mastercard
[ Pix                 ]  PagBank
[ Vineland             ]  Pay with Vineland (USDC or PYUSD)   <- this is yours
[ Boleto              ]  ...
```

When buyer clicks **Place Order**:

1. Plugin calls `POST /api/v1/orders` on the Vineland backend with
   `brl_amount = <WC order total>`, `external_ref = wc_<WC order id>`.
2. Vineland returns `checkout_url`.
3. WC redirects buyer to that URL.
4. Buyer signs in their Stellar wallet.
5. Vineland listener confirms payment and POSTs `order.paid` to
   `/wc-api/wc_vineland`.
6. Plugin verifies HMAC, calls `WC_Order::payment_complete( $tx_hash )`.
7. Buyer is redirected back to the WC "Thank you" page.

Total time from "Place Order" click to "Order completed": ~10–15
seconds (depends on wallet flow speed; on-chain finality is ~6s).

## What merchants see

In **WooCommerce → Orders**, paid orders show:

- Status: **Completed** (auto-set by `payment_complete()`)
- Order notes:
  - "Vineland order created. Awaiting on-chain payment." (at checkout)
  - "Vineland order.paid confirmed. tx: 20655a78..." (after webhook)
- Custom meta visible via Order → Custom Fields:
  - `_vineland_order_id` (UUID matching Vineland's `orders.id`)
  - `_vineland_memo` (the 64-hex memo for the on-chain payment)
  - `_vineland_usdc_amount`
  - `_vineland_tx_hash` (after payment)

## Webhook events handled

| event | WC behavior |
|---|---|
| `order.paid` | `payment_complete()`, status → Completed |
| `subscription.charged` | same as `order.paid` (recurring) |
| `order.underpaid` | status → On hold, with expected/received note |
| `order.expired` | status → Cancelled |
| `order.cancelled` | status → Cancelled |

## Refunds

v0.1 does **not** support refunds via the Vineland API. The merchant has
full control of their Stellar address; to refund, send USDC back to the
buyer's address manually using a Stellar wallet. Add an order note in WC
for the refund tx hash.

v0.4 will add an in-plugin refund button that initiates a USDC return
from the merchant's wallet (via wallet-connect signature, not custodied).

## Testing

1. Switch the plugin **Environment** to `testnet`.
2. Create a test product (R$1.00 or similar) on your WC store.
3. Buy it as a logged-out user. Pick Vineland.
4. Use a Stellar testnet wallet (Freighter on testnet) to pay.
5. Watch WC admin → Orders for the order to flip to Completed.
6. Switch Environment to `mainnet` and repeat with real USDC for a final
   smoke test before going live.

## Common issues

| symptom | cause | fix |
|---|---|---|
| "Vineland" not showing at checkout | gateway disabled OR API key empty | check Payments settings |
| Order stuck in Pending after buyer pays | webhook URL not reachable | verify `https://your-store.com/wc-api/wc_vineland` returns 4xx not 5xx (404 is fine — POST works) |
| "invalid signature" in plugin logs | webhook secret mismatch | rotate on both sides; secrets must match exactly |
| "wc order not found" in plugin logs | external_ref didn't store | check `_vineland_order_id` meta on the WC order; if missing, the create_order call failed |
| 401 from Vineland API | wrong API key | rotate the key on dashboard, paste the new one |
