# Vineland — Mainnet Readiness Checklist

> Cross-reference: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-07-vineland-design.md` §9 (security checklist)
> and §10 (out-of-scope items). Read the spec before working through this checklist.
>
> **Rule:** If any item below is unchecked, do **not** flip any merchant to mainnet.
> The toggle is `merchants.network = 'mainnet'` and must be executed via direct DB UPDATE by Manuel
> — never through the dashboard — until this checklist is fully closed.

## 3. Operational

### 3.1 Infrastructure

- [ ] Listener deployed on Fly.io GRU region with health check endpoint responding 200

- [ ] Edge functions deployed to **prod** Supabase project (`vineland-prod`) — separate project, separate service-role key
  - Pass: `supabase functions list --project-ref <prod-ref>` shows all functions with status `active`; prod ref ≠ staging ref
- [ ] Migrations run cleanly on both staging and prod with zero errors
  - Pass: `supabase db remote commit` dry-run shows no pending diffs; migration history table matches repo `supabase/migrations/`
- [ ] `pg_cron` job scheduled and verified firing every 5 min on both projects (expire stale pending orders)

  - Pass: 3 merchant records in `merchants` table with `network = 'testnet'`; each has at least one `orders` record with `status = 'paid'`
- [ ] Each pilot merchant's webhook receiver verified: endpoint returns 200 on POST; merchant confirms HMAC signature verification on their side
  - Pass: webhook delivery log shows successful delivery to each merchant's endpoint; written confirmation from merchant contact

  - Pass: file exists; covers API key rotation, webhook secret rotation, trustline requirement, mainnet address verification
- [ ] Embeddable SDK or postMessage protocol: **deferred to Plan D**
  - Note: this is a hard gate — do not launch public SDK until Plan D spec is written and reviewed. Merchants must use server-side API integration only at mainnet launch.

---

## 5. Per-Merchant Smoke Gate (testnet → mainnet transition)

Run this gate for **each individual merchant** before flipping their network flag. Do not batch.

- [ ] Merchant has confirmed receipt of mainnet API key and webhook secret (separate from testnet credentials)
  - Pass: confirmation message on record (email or Telegram); credentials delivered via secure channel (not plain email)
- [ ] Merchant's webhook endpoint responded successfully (HTTP 200) to at least 3 test deliveries on testnet in the past 7 days
  - Pass: `webhook_deliveries` table shows 3 successful deliveries to this merchant's endpoint within the window
- [ ] Merchant's mainnet Stellar address verified by manually paying 0.01 USDC (testnet equivalent) and confirming receipt
  - Pass: Horizon transaction record of test payment; merchant acknowledges receipt
- [ ] Merchant has signed off on integration testing in writing
  - Pass: written sign-off on record (email or signed doc)
- [ ] Mainnet trustline added on merchant's Stellar address for Circle USDC issuer
  - Issuer address: `GA5ZSEJYB37JRC5AVCIA5MOP4RHTM335X2KGX3IHOJAPP5RE34K4KZVN`
  - Pass: `GET https://horizon.stellar.org/accounts/<merchant-address>` shows `balances[]` entry with `asset_code: "USDC"` and `asset_issuer: GA5ZSEJYB37JRC5AVCIA5MOP4RHTM335X2KGX3IHOJAPP5RE34K4KZVN`
- [ ] `merchants.network` flipped to `'mainnet'` via direct DB UPDATE by Manuel only
  - Command: `UPDATE merchants SET network = 'mainnet' WHERE id = '<merchant-id>';`
  - Pass: executed on prod DB; confirmed by `SELECT network FROM merchants WHERE id = '<merchant-id>';`
  - **Never** expose this transition through the dashboard until the full mainnet readiness checklist is closed.

## 6. Final Go / No-Go

All sections above must be fully checked before any merchant goes to mainnet. The following sign-offs are required with date:

- [ ] **Marco (founder)** — confirms partnership readiness, pilot merchant readiness, product completeness
  - Date: ___________
- [ ] **Manuel (architect)** — confirms infrastructure, security posture, operational runbooks
  - Date: ___________
- [ ] **Legal counsel (named firm + OAB)** — confirms regulatory classification and ToS/Privacy Policy adequacy
  - Firm: ___________  Date: ___________
- [ ] **Security auditor (named firm)** — confirms all P0/P1 findings resolved; no open HIGH/CRITICAL
  - Firm: ___________  Date: ___________

## 7. Failure Modes if Mainnet Flipped Before Checklist Closed

These are the concrete risks gated by the items above. Each failure mode references the control that prevents it.

| Failure mode | Impact | Gating control |
|---|---|---|
| **Funds loss via on-chain redirect** — attacker replaces merchant Stellar address between order creation and payment matching | Buyer pays attacker; merchant never receives funds; Vineland liable | Security audit on `apps/api` (§2.1) + matcher logic audit (`apps/listener/src/matcher.ts`) |
| **Regulatory enforcement by Banco Central** — Vineland classified as PSAV instead of technology provider | Forced shutdown, fines, criminal exposure for founders | Legal opinion (§1.3) — this is a binary gate, not a risk to manage down |
| **Webhook URL pointing to attacker-controlled host (SSRF)** — malicious merchant registers internal URL; listener exfiltrates internal network responses | Internal service compromise; credential leakage | SSRF guard enforced in `apps/listener/src/ssrf.ts` before every outbound webhook call; confirmed by audit (§2.1) |
| **Listener silent failure** — process dies or falls behind Horizon cursor; payments go unmatched indefinitely | Merchants receive no webhook; orders stuck as `pending`; manual reconciliation required | Staleness alert > 60 s (§3.2); listener crash runbook (§3.3) |
| **Stellar SDK upgrade breaks production** — upstream `@stellar/stellar-sdk` change alters transaction parsing or Horizon response schema | Matcher silently drops valid payments; revenue loss | CI smoke tests against testnet on every dependency bump (enabled by Plan C task 7); `apps/listener/src/horizon.ts` is the integration surface to watch |
| **pg_cron job silently stops** — expired orders never cleaned up; `pending` orders accumulate; matcher retries orders past TTL | Merchant double-charges buyer if buyer retries manually | pg_cron monitoring via `cron.job_run_details` alert (§3.1) |
