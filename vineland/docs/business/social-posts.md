> The pain isn't subtle. Brazilian SaaS exporters pay roughly 7-8% on

> the IOF cross-border FX, which jumped from 0.38% to 3.5% in May 2025.
> On top of that, 15-25% of LATAM cross-border card transactions
> silently fail (Rapyd 2025). A R$50k/month exporter sees R$25k/year
> evaporate in fees and another R$120k/year in failed-payment churn
> that never makes it to their dashboard.

> Vineland routes the same invoice through Stellar in 6 seconds. USDC

> BR VASP anchor. The IOF, the chargeback, the FX spread, the silent
> card decline — none of them exist on this path.

## post 3 · Twitter/X thread (5 tweets) · narrative insight from the build

**1/5** · 6 audits closed in one day. 8 critical + 14 high findings. We
documented every one with CVSS, exploit path, fix sketch, and a
falsifiable prediction we now have to honor.
github.com/Galmanus/vineland/tree/main/docs/security

**2/5** · The worst finding: WooCommerce webhook bypass at CVSS 9.1.
v0.1 plugin accepted unauthenticated `order.paid` events from anywhere
on the internet. v0.2 closes it with required HMAC secret + listener-
aligned signature + replay protection. Signed release published.

**3/5** · The next-worst: listener SSRF. Merchant could register a
webhook URL whose DNS resolves to 169.254.169.254 — AWS/GCP cloud
metadata. We added DNS-resolve + IP pinning via undici Agent + extended
blocklist (CGNAT, ULA, link-local, IPv4-mapped IPv6).

**4/5** · The subtle one: BigInt money math. Stellar amounts are 7-dp
decimal strings. `Number()` round-trip is non-deterministic at the
stroop boundary. We rewrote the matcher to operate in BigInt stroops
with floor-truncation to merchant.

**5/5** · Why this matters: Vineland is going to mainnet. Merchants
will route real money through this code. Audit-first isn't ceremony —
it's the only way a 2-person team gets to ship payments infra without
becoming the next headline. @StellarOrg
