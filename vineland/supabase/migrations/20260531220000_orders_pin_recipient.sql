-- Pin the merchant's payout (Stellar) address onto each order at creation.
--
-- Before this, the checkout page (routes/orders.ts) and the listener matcher
-- (apps/listener) resolved merchant_stellar_address via a LIVE join to the
-- merchants table. A merchant who rotated their Stellar address after a buyer
-- consented could redirect the funds of an in-flight order, or break the match
-- so a paid order never credits. This is the SettlementAgent "recipient-drift"
-- defense made real in the live charge path: the consented recipient is pinned
-- at order creation and is what both checkout and settlement use thereafter.

-- Backfill existing orders from their merchant's current address (one-time;
