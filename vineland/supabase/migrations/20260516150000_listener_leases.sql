-- Two listener pods both running watchAccount for the same merchant
-- account is a duplicate-charge / duplicate-delivery hazard, especially
-- during rolling deploys when the old pod overlaps the new pod for a
-- few seconds.

-- Lease-table approach: each pod acquires a per-account lease with TTL,
-- heartbeats while alive, releases on graceful shutdown. Crash-safe by
-- virtue of TTL — the next pod that polls past expires_at takes over.
-- Supabase JS service-role client supports the upsert/conditional-update
-- shape this needs without raw SQL.
