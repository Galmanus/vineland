// Audit-005 · H1 — trustworthy client-IP derivation.
//
// THREAT: the previous code took `X-Forwarded-For.split(",")[0]` (the
// LEFT-MOST hop). XFF is appended to by each proxy, so the left-most entry is
// whatever the *client* sent — fully attacker-controlled. A caller rotating
// `X-Forwarded-For: <random>` on every request defeats every per-IP limiter
// and mints unbounded pending orders. We must never trust the left-most hop.
//
// CORRECT MODEL: our own nginx is the only trusted proxy. nginx APPENDS the
// real socket peer as the RIGHT-MOST hop of XFF. So with one trusted proxy,
// the rightmost hop is the genuine client IP; everything to its left is
// forgeable. We read a fixed depth from the RIGHT, configurable via
// TRUSTED_PROXY_HOPS (default 1 = "nginx is the only proxy in front of us").
//
// BEST: when the server exposes the real connection remote address we use it
// directly and ignore headers entirely. Deno's `Deno.serve` passes the
// connection info as the second handler argument, which Hono surfaces as
// `c.env.remoteAddr` (see hono/adapter/deno getConnInfo). When that is present
// (production), the XFF parsing below is only a fallback for setups where the
// remote addr is the proxy's loopback rather than the real client.

// How many proxy hops we trust between us and the public internet. Our nginx
// adds exactly one hop (the real client socket addr), so default 1.

  const raw = Deno.env.get("TRUSTED_PROXY_HOPS");
