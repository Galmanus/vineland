# Deploy vineland-subscription contract to Stellar MAINNET.
#
# Prereqs (operator-side, MUST be true before running):
#   1. `stellar keys add vineland-mainnet-deployer` already configured
#      (or `stellar keys generate vineland-mainnet-deployer`).
#   2. Deployer account funded with ≥30 XLM mainnet
#      (covers upload ~5 XLM + deploy ~1 XLM + reserves + buffer).
#   3. WASM built (run `cargo build --release --target wasm32v1-none --locked`).
#   4. F5 e2e signed charge gate passed on testnet (audit-002 F5).
#
# Output:
#   .mainnet-deploy.env  (CONTRACT_ID + WASM_HASH for the listener flip)
#
# This script is idempotent on re-run for the same wasm hash — `upload`
# returns the same hash, `deploy` writes a new instance only if the
# source account hasn't deployed this wasm at this nonce yet.
