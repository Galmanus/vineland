# Deploy vineland-smart-wallet contract to Stellar testnet.
# Mirror of contracts/subscription/deploy-testnet.sh — same conventions so
# the listener/backend can locate the deployed wasm hash via .testnet-deploy.env.
#
# Prereq:
#   stellar-cli installed (cargo install --locked stellar-cli)
#   rustup target add wasm32v1-none
#   cd contracts/smart-wallet/
#
# Output:
#   .testnet-deploy.env  (CONTRACT_ID + WASM_HASH for vineland backend integration)
#
# Per-user wallets are deployed separately at runtime from this wasm hash —
# each customer gets a fresh contract instance instantiated with their
# passkey via `init`. This script only uploads + deploys the canonical
# template instance for verification.
