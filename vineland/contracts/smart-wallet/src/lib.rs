//! Vineland Smart Wallet — Soroban custom account with on-chain spending policies.
//!
//! **Composition with `vineland-subscription`.** This contract is intended to be
//! the `buyer` (a C-address smart account) in a vineland-subscription. The
//! subscription contract's `charge()` invokes `token.transfer(buyer, merchant,
//! amount)` which triggers Soroban's auth machinery on the buyer. With a
//! classic G-address buyer, that means the buyer must sign every charge. With
//! this smart wallet as buyer, `__check_auth` is consulted instead, and
//! authorization is granted *without a fresh signature* as long as the call
//! matches an active on-chain spending policy that the user pre-installed.
//!
//! **The product property this enables.** The spending limit (per-merchant
//! max amount, period, expiry, revocation) lives in this contract's
//! persistent storage — not in any Vineland backend, not in any custodian.
//! Only the user, via a passkey/WebAuthn signature, can install, modify, or
//! revoke a policy. Vineland's backend, the merchant, and the network
//! validators cannot bypass the policy. This is what Stripe structurally
//! cannot offer: a user-enforced limit that the platform itself cannot
//! override.
//!
//! **v0.1 scope (spike).** Single-signer (one passkey per wallet). Per-merchant
//! policies keyed by the merchant Address. The merchant authorizes via
//! `token.transfer(this_wallet, merchant, amount)`. `__check_auth` decodes
//! the auth context, looks up the per-merchant policy, validates cap +
//! interval + revocation + expiry, and authorizes without consulting the
//! passkey. For any context that does not match a policy (e.g. an
//! `install_policy` or `revoke_policy` invocation), `__check_auth` verifies
//! the passkey's secp256r1 signature over the host-provided payload.
//!
//! **Passkey verification.** Soroban Protocol 21 added native secp256r1
//! verification (CAP-0051) — the curve used by WebAuthn / passkeys. The
//! wallet stores the passkey's secp256r1 public key (65-byte uncompressed
//! X9.62) and credential id at `init` time. `__check_auth` invokes
//! `env.crypto().secp256r1_verify(pubkey, payload, signature)` which panics
//! on failure (translated by the host into an auth rejection).
//!
//! For the v0.1 spike, `signature_payload` is the raw host-provided digest
//! and `signature` is the raw 64-byte (r || s) secp256r1 signature. The
//! frontend is responsible for delivering a signature that satisfies this.
//! Full WebAuthn unwrapping (authenticatorData + clientDataJSON binding)
//! lands in v0.2 — concretely, the wallet will require the frontend to pass
//! both blobs and verify that `sha256(authenticatorData || sha256(clientDataJSON))`
//! equals `signature_payload` before running secp256r1_verify.
//!
//! TTL: every persistent `set` is followed by `extend_ttl`, mirroring the
//! audit-002 F1 pattern from `vineland-subscription`.

#![no_std]
// The contract's public API surface (install_policy / install_agent_session /
// __check_auth) intentionally takes more than clippy's 7-argument threshold —
// each parameter is a distinct on-chain policy field, and bundling them into a
// struct would change the contract ABI the off-chain scripts and frontend call.
// The `#[contractimpl]` macro also generates client methods that inherit these
// arities. Scope the allow at crate level so macro-expanded code is covered too.
#![allow(clippy::too_many_arguments)]
// `env.events().publish(...)` is deprecated in soroban-sdk 26.1.x in favor of
// the `#[contractevent]` macro. Migrating would change the on-chain event
// encoding (topic/data layout) that indexers and the SSL drift detector bind to
// (see install_agent_session). Out of scope for the C2/C3 audit fixes; keep the
// existing event ABI; the only deprecated usage in this crate is these five
// intentional `publish` calls, so allow `deprecated` at crate level.
